# ModularMC
A modular Minecraft server made in Rust.

# Plans
This project is meant to make every single aspect of the game toggleable. You want the beta terrain generator in 1.18? Sure. Want Netherite in 1.12? I suppose so. Want all the performance and modularity in one place without having to know how to run servers whatsoever? Me too, and you can with ModularMC!
